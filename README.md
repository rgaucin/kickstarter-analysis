---
An analysis of the results of thousands of kickstarter campaigns, with focus on campaigns for theater projects in the US and stage musical projects in Great Britain.

According to the data, a campaign for a theater project in the US should set a goal of about $3000 and should aim to be launched in May (as evidenced by the Kickstarter Outcomes By Month chart). A campaign for a musical project should set a goal of about $2,000.
